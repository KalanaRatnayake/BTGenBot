"""The behavior tree represents a robot's navigation system with arm activity. The robot must visit the location "ArucoStand", then follow the arucos given their IDs: 10, 1, and 7. Finally the robot reset the manipulator to the parking position and goes to the location "Parking". The only available actions that must be used in the behavior tree are: "MoveTo", "FollowAruco" and "ResetManipulator"."""
